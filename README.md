## Background

The RESTful API is built using JSON Server, which allows for quick setup and deployment of a mock REST API. This template can be easily modified to suit your needs, whether you're developing a new project or enhancing an existing one. For more detailed instructions on building from scratch, you can refer to [this guide](https://ivo-culic.medium.com/create-restful-api-with-json-server-and-deploy-it-to-vercel-d56061c1157a).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
